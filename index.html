    <h3>Question 1:
        Write a program that asks the user for two numbers. Perform the following: <br>
        Add, subtract, multiply, and divide the two numbers using arithmetic operators. <br>
        Compare the two numbers using comparison operators (>, <,==) and log the result. <br>
            Use an assignment operator (+=) to add 5 to the first number and log the updated value.

    <h3>
        Question 2:
        Create a program that accepts the user's first name, last name, and age as inputs. The program should: <br>
        Concatenate the first and last name to display the full name. <br>
        Use a ternary operator to check if the user is 18 or older and display a message indicating whether they are
        eligible to vote. <br>
        Use a string operator to calculate the length of the full name and log whether the name is longer than 10
        characters.

    <h3>
        Question 3:
        Build a program that takes a number from the user and: <br>
        Performs both modulus and exponentiation on the number (e.g., number % 2, number ** 2) and displays the results.
        <br>
        Use a comparison operator to check if the number is greater than 50, and log "Greater than 50" or "Less than or
        equal to 50." <br>
        Use a ternary operator to check if the number is odd or even.

    <h3>
        Question 4:
        Write a program that takes three numbers from the user. The program should: <br>
        Add the first two numbers and display the result. <br>
        Compare the sum of the first two numbers with the third number using comparison operators. <br>
        Use a logical operator (&&) to check if the sum of the first two numbers is greater than 50 and the third number
        is less than 100, and log the result.

    <h3>Question 5:
        Create a program where the user inputs two strings (e.g., a first name and a last name) and a number. The
        program should: <br>
        Concatenate the strings and display the full name. <br>
        Use the typeof operator to check if the number is of type number and display the result. <br>
        Use assignment operators to increment the number by 10 and log the new value.

    <h3>Question 6:
        Write a program that simulates a shopping cart: <br>
        Ask the user to input the total amount. <br>
        Use a ternary operator to apply a 15% discount if the total is over $150; otherwise, apply no discount. <br>
        Use assignment operators to update the total amount after the discount and log the final price.

    <h3>Question 7:
        Create a program that accepts a sentence from the user and: <br>
        Use string operators to reverse the sentence. <br>
        Check if the reversed sentence is longer than 15 characters using a comparison operator. <br>
        Use a logical operator (||) to log a message if either the original or reversed sentence has more than 20
        characters.

    <h3>
        Question 8:
        Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user. The program should: <br>
        Perform a bitwise &, |, and ^ operation on the numbers and display the results. <br>
        Shift the bits of the first number two places to the left and display the result. <br>
        Compare the original and shifted number using comparison operators and log the results.

    <h3>Question 9:
        Create a program that evaluates a person's eligibility for a loan. The program should: <br>
        Ask for the person's age, salary, and credit score. <br>
        Use logical operators (&&, ||) to check if the person is eligible for a loan (e.g., age â‰¥ 21, salary > $30,000, or credit score > 650). <br>
        Log whether the person is approved or denied based on these conditions.

        <h3>
            Question 10:
            Write a program that calculates the total score of a student based on three input scores: <br>
            Add the scores using arithmetic operators. <br>
            Use a ternary operator to check if the total score is 60 or above to display "Passed" or "Failed." <br>
            Use assignment operators to add bonus points (5) to the total score if it's below 60, then recheck if the student has passed or failed after applying the bonus. <br>
